## Native Multi-Speaker Support

Text can assigned to a wide variety of voices across different personas.

## Voice Variety

Over 3000+ community shared voices. Voices can also be created either by providing a prompt or an audio file for approximation (cloning).

## Realism of Speaker Transitions

Multi-speaker transcripts must be processed in chunks as context isn't retained between requests. The resulting voices sound natural, but emotional continuity across chunks may vary.
