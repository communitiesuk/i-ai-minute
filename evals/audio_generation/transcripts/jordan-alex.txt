Alex: Hey Jordan, thanks for meeting me. I wanted to get your thoughts on the new project proposal.

Jordan: Of course! I actually just finished reviewing it this morning. I think the timeline is ambitious but achievable.

Alex: That's good to hear. My main concern is the budget. Do you think we have enough allocated for the research phase?

Jordan: Honestly? I think we're cutting it close. We might need an additional ten to fifteen percent to be safe.

Alex: I was thinking the same thing. What if we reallocate some funds from the marketing budget?

Jordan: That could work, but we'd need to get Sarah's approval first. She's pretty protective of that budget.

Alex: True. Maybe we should schedule a meeting with her next week to discuss it?

Jordan: Sounds like a plan. I'll send out a calendar invite this afternoon.

Alex: Perfect. Thanks for your insight, Jordan. This really helps.

Jordan: Anytime! Let's make this project a success.
