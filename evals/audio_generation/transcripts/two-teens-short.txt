Teen 1:  
Okay, but seriously, you have to admit that today felt like the longest school day in the history of school days. I swear that last maths period was actually three hours long.

Teen 2:  
Three hours? Try five. I looked at the clock, and it said 2:15. I looked again what felt like a whole episode of something later, and it still said 2:15. I thought time had actually stopped.
