Teen 1:  
Okay, but seriously, you have to admit that today felt like the longest school day in the history of school days. I swear that last maths period was actually three hours long.

Teen 2:  
Three hours? Try five. I looked at the clock, and it said 2:15. I looked again what felt like a whole episode of something later, and it still said 2:15. I thought time had actually stopped.

Teen 1:  
Honestly, I think Mr. Patel has some kind of time‑slowing superpower. Like, he starts talking about fractions and suddenly the universe just… freezes.

Teen 2:  
Yeah, but then the bell rings and everyone sprints out like it’s the Olympics. I nearly got run over by Josh and his giant backpack.

Teen 1:  
Josh’s backpack is basically a weapon. I’m convinced he’s carrying bricks in there. Or maybe a whole desktop computer.

Teen 2:  
He probably is. Anyway, what are you doing after school? You still coming over? I finally fixed the controller, so we can actually play without it drifting to the left every five seconds.

Teen 1:  
Oh thank goodness. Last time I tried to walk in a straight line and my character just wandered off a cliff. I’m still traumatised.

Teen 2:  
You’re traumatised? I was the one trying to revive you while you kept sliding away like a shopping trolley with a broken wheel.

Teen 1:  
Okay, fair. But I’m definitely coming over. I just need to grab a snack first because I’m starving. I had lunch at like… what, eleven? That’s basically breakfast.

Teen 2:  
Grab something good then. And bring extra, because you know I’m going to steal half of it anyway.

Teen 1:  
I know. That’s why I always bring two snacks. One for me, and one for you to “borrow forever.”

Teen 2:  
That’s not borrowing, that’s friendship. Anyway, hurry up. I want to beat that level today. No drifting, no cliffs, no disasters.

Teen 1:  
No promises. But I’ll try. See you in a bit.
